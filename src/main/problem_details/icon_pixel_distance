You are given a device with a touch screen of 1080 pixels in height and 1920 pixels
in width. The pixels are numbered from 0.

There are N icons on the screen and they are numbered from 0 to N-1. The positions of
icons are described by arrays A and B. Specifically, for every icon number J,
(A[J], B[J]) is the icon's position on the screen (using x and y coordinates
consecutively).

To select an icon, you have to tap the screen within a circular area of radius 20
pixels, centered on the icon's position. You can assume that there is always at most
one icon within range of the tap.

For example, if an icon's position is (500, 500), then you can select it by tapping
the screen at position (505, 510) o r(520, 500), but not at (520, 480).

The devices detected a tap at position (X,Y), Which icon, if any, was selected?

Write a function: fun solution(A: IntArray, B: IntArray, X: Int, Y: Int): Int

that, given two arrays A and B of length N, representing icons' positions, and
values X and Y, where (X,Y) represents the coordinates of the tap, returns the number
(index) of the icon that was selected or -1 if no icon was selected.

Examples:

1. Given A = [100, 200, 100], B = [50, 100, 100], X = 100, and Y = 100, your function
should return 2. The tapped point (100, 100) is also the center of icon 2.

2. Given A = [100, 200, 100], B = [50, 100, 100], X = 100 and Y = 70, your function
should return 0. The tapped point (100,70) is within range of icon 0.

3. Given A = [100, 200, 100], B = [50, 100, 100], X = 200 and Y = 60, your function
should return -1 since the tapped point (200, 60) is not within range of any icon.

Assume that:
- there is at most one icon within tapping range of (X,Y)
- N is an integer within the range [1..100]
- each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..1,919]
- each element of array B is an integer within the range [0..1,079]
- X is an integer within the range of [0..1,919]
- Y is an integer within the range of [0..1,079]

 * Screen is 1080 x 1920 starting from 0
 * N icons on screen numbered 0 to N-1
 * Must tap within 20 pixels of icons center
 *
 * 1. Find each icon position and store in variable
 * 2. store the tap location
 * 3. Store the max distance for tap to count (20 pixels)
 * 4. Add the X and Y position of icons
 * 5. Check all three icons to see if the absolute value of the icon is
