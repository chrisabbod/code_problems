The median of a list of number is essentially its middle element after sorting. The same number of elements occur after
it as before. Given a list of numbers with an odd number of elements, find the median?

Example
arr = [5,3,1,2,4]
The sorted array arr = [1,2,3,4,5]. The middle element and the median is 3.

Function Description
Complete the findMedian function in the editor below. findMedian has the following parameter(s):
int arr[n]: an unsorted array of integers

Returns
int: the median of the array

Input Format
The first line contains the integer n, the size of arr. The second line contains n space-separated integers arr[i]

Constraints
1 <= n <= 1000001
n is odd
-10000 <= arr[i] <= 100000

Sample Input 0
7
0 1 2 4 6 5 3

Sample Output 0
3

Explanation 0
The sorted arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]. It's middle element is at arr[3] = 3.

Sample Input 1
7
5 9 0 -11 5000 -60 8

Sample Output 1
5

Explanation 1
The sorted arr = [-60, -11, 0, 5, 8, 9, 5000]. It's middle element is at arr[3] = 5.
