The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number after the first two is the sum of the prior two.
As an illustration, here is a short sequence given starting values of (0,1): Fibonacci series = (0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13).

Given an integer n, calculate the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence given starting elements of (0,1).
Return an array of n integers, including the given (0,1) in the sequence.

fibonacci has the following parameter(s): int n - the length of the Fibonacci series to return
Return: int[n] - an array of n Fibonacci numbers starting with (0,1)

Constraints 1 <= n <= 10
